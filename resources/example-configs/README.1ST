To enable downloading from servers (demos, maps) you will need to do two things:


1) softlink to your server ID1 directory (ie. ln -s /home/myuser/ktxserver/ID1 ID1)

2) softlink to your server demos directory (ie. ln -s /home/myuser/ktxserver/demos demos)


In the QTV main directory. This will allow players to download recorded demos
and maps that are on the server as long as the server is configured properly.
